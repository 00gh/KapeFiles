- [ ] I have generated a unique GUID for my Target(s)/Module(s)
- [ ] I have placed the Target/Module in an appropriate subfolder in Targets or Modules. If one doesn't exist, I have either added it to the Misc folder or created a relevant subfolder **with justification**
- [ ] I have set or updated the version of my Target(s)/Module(s)
- [ ] I have verified that KAPE parses the Target successfully via kape.exe, using `--tlist`/`--mlist` and corrected any errors 
- [ ] I have consulted either the [Target Guide](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Targets/TargetGuide.guide), [Target Template](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Targets/TargetTemplate.template), [Compound Target Guide](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Targets/CompoundTargetGuide.guide), or [Compound Target Template](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Targets/CompoundTargetTemplate.template) to ensure my Target(s) follow the same format
