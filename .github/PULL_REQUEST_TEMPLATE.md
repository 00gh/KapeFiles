- [ ] I have generated a unique `GUID` for my Target(s)/Module(s)
- [ ] I have placed the Target(s)/Module(s) in an appropriate subfolder in Targets or Modules. If one doesn't exist, I have either added it to the `Misc` folder or created a relevant subfolder **with justification**
- [ ] I have set or updated the version of my Target(s)/Module(s)
- [ ] I have verified that KAPE parses the Target(s)/Module(s) successfully via kape.exe, using `--tlist`/`--mlist` and corrected any errors 
- [ ] I have validated my Target(s)/Module(s) against test data and verified they are working as intended
- [ ] I have made an attempt to document the artifacts within the Target(s) or Module(s) I am submitting. If documentation doesn't exist, I have placed `N/A` underneath the Documentation header
- [ ] For Targets, I have consulted either the [Target Guide](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Targets/TargetGuide.guide), [Target Template](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Targets/TargetTemplate.template), [Compound Target Guide](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Targets/CompoundTargetGuide.guide), or [Compound Target Template](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Targets/CompoundTargetTemplate.template) to ensure my Target(s) follow the same format
- [ ] For Modules, I have consulted either the [Module Guide](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Modules/ModuleGuide.guide), [Module Template](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Modules/ModuleTemplate.template), [Compound Module Guide](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Modules/CompoundModuleGuide.guide), or [Compound Module Template](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Modules/CompoundModuleTemplate.template) to ensure my Module(s) follow the same format
